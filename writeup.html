    <p>&emsp;&emsp; The method I used to explore and visualize the data give to me was using Python and its packages. 
    The main packages I used were NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Regex. By utlizing all these packages together I was able to 
    successfully clean and visualize the given data in order to make meaningful conclusions. The computing environment I used 
    to code and display my graphs was Jupyter Notebooks. This environment allowed me to easily see all my code at once and start 
    new scripts by simply creating new cells to code in. Since I am every comfortbale with Python and the packages I used the coding 
    to make the visualization for this assignment wasn't too difficult in fact I found it fun! I also have a lot of experince cleaning
    data so that wasn't too much of a problem. I was more worried about if the graphs were going to be useful for the CEO and if 
    they were going to be viewed more than just spaghetti graphs. 
    <br>
    <br>
    &emsp;&emsp; Exploring the data was very interesting. I initally focused on the Hamburger sales since we had questions about how
    Burger King's Impossible Burger effected the market. I was able to answer this question by finding a lose in sales for 
    McDonald's once the Impossible Burger was introduced by a competitor. While exploring and cleaning the data to answer that 
    question I got confortable with the data and was able to find some other interesting trends. Such as the Hamburger sales ranking 
    by different regions allowing us to target the regions with more or less sales. Also finding an interesting phenomena of there 
    being a huge spike in Fish Fillet sales on Fridays in almost all the regions. 
    <br>

    &emsp;&emsp; The method I used to make my website was simply just HTML and CSS coding. This wasn't too difficult for me since 
    I've had a fair share of web development experience. I was however stumbled by the fact that I needed to create a site that can 
    simply explain my findings to a CEO. I had a hard time trying to find the gray area for how many words to write or how techincal 
    to be. This was maybe the most difficult part of the assignment for me, but I hope as we do more projects my ability to recongize 
    what to write gets easier. Another road bump was creating code that allowed my PDF file to be downloadable which was some PHP coding, but nothing too difficult. Overall, the project was fairly difficult, but the creative aspect behind it was something
    I really enjoyed and would like to do again.
