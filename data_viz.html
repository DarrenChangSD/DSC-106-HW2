The vertical blue line is used to indicate the month of October 2018. There is a huge drop in sales for Hamburgers right on the month of October 2018 which is the same month Burger King released the Impossible Burger. After this drop McDonald's Hamburger sales continue to stay lower than before the month of October 2018. This concludes that the release of the Impossible burger caused our Hamburger sales to drop. To validate this effect I checked this across all our regions and there was a similar drop in all other regions as well Figure 2 shows this.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp; Insight: In order to comptete with Burger King we should also release a new burger since their new burger caused our 
            sales to drop.

Figure 4 highlights the mean sale lines created in Figure 3 in order to reduce clutter. This way we can clearly see that the sales by region goes North East, South West, North West, South East, and Center. 
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp; Insight: By understanding which regions have more sales we can focus on advertising our brand more in regions with 
            higher sales to get more customers.

The vertical blue lines are used to indicate the Fridays of the month. There is a spike in sales for Fish Fillet every Friday. To validate this trend I checked this across all our regions and there was a similar spike in all other regions on Fridays as well, Figure 6 shows this.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp; Insight: Fish Fillets are very popular on Fridays. We can use this to our advantage we need to find the root cause for 
            this trend and try to extend it to other days.
